Our project contains sensitive contents including the following:

## Data Structure
Our data is in .csv format, which can be opened in Microsoft Excel (or whatever you want) for easy annotating. The first row contains the categories to which you will refer when going through the annotation instructions. Each row refers to the Tweet that is in text format in the first column, and annotations for that text are to follow it in the same row.
